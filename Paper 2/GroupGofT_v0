%{ 
    This program will consider the spike trains of N neurons in a neural
    network connected according to the connectivity matrix, con.  We will
    use Dijkstra's algorithm to determine what the neighbor distance is
    between all neurons.  After this, we will calculate the correlation
    coefficient between all neural spike trains.
